provided by this package.}
\usage{
get_forecasters(
  response,
  incidence_period = c("epiweek"),
  ahead,
  forecast_date,
  geo_type = c("county", "state", "hrr", "msa"),
  n_locations = 200

\arguments{
\item{response}{the response (e.g. "usafacts_deaths_incidence_num")}

\item{incidence_period}{the incidence period (e.g. "epiweek" for
now, for all forecasters)}

\item{ahead}{the ahead parameter (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4)}

\item{forecast_date}{the date of the forecast}

\item{geo_type}{the geographic type (e.g "county" or "state" or
"hrr" or "msa"... but for now only the first two),}

\item{n_locations}{the number of locations (for now we will use 200
for this)}
}
\value{
a named list, with each element of the list consisting of a
    forecaster function and type (one of `c("standalone",
    "ensemble")`). Unavailable forecasters are marked as
    `list(forecaster = NA, type = "standalone")`.
}
\description{
The evaluator will first call this function with the
    parameters shown below to determine all the forecasters
    available. It expects to get back a named list of lists of
    forecasting functions and types. If a forecasting function is
    not available for a given set of parameters, an `NA` should
    returned _instead of_ a function. This tells the evaluator to
    ignore that forecaster in a run: it ignores anything that is
    not a function. See examples in code below.
