# This script contains aligners: functions used to compute aligned time.
# Each aligner should take as input:
#   df_use: a data frame, of the same form as the upstream df
#   forecast_date: a canonical parameter used by the evaluator.
# and output a data frame
#   df_align: a data frame with columns location, time_value, and align_date.
# 
# Each aligner should satisfy the "aligner guarantee". 
# This guarantees that an aligned date is computed for
# 
# --every location at which data has been observed
# --every date at which data has been observed
# --every date in the target period, defined by the forecast_date.
