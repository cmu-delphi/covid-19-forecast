# This script contains the functions needed to build modelers.
# Each modeler is a list comprised of exactly two elements: a fitter and a predictor.
# Hence, this script contains two types of functions: model fitting functions, and model predicting functions.
# Model fitting functions take in data and produce a fitted model.
# A fitted model is a function which can take in data, and produce a (point) prediction.
# All model fitting functions should take the following arguments as inputs:
#   Y: numeric vector
#   X: numeric matrix, with default X = NULL
#   wts: numeric vector, with default wts = rep(1, length(Y))
#   offset: numeric vector, with default offset = NULL
#   intercept: logical, with default intercept = TRUE
#   locs: character vector, identifying each observation with a location.
#
# and possibly
#   t: numeric vector, identifying each observation with a point in "aligned time".
#                      To be used in forward-validation.
#
# Model predicting functions take in a fitted model, and produce predictions.
# All model predicting functions should take the following arguments as inputs:
#   fit: the fitted model used for prediction
#   X: numeric matrix
#   offset: numeric vector
#
#  and possibly
#
#   locs: character vector, identifying each observation with a location.
# These arguments should not have defaults.
