# Exploration Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks that we have run to explore the effectiveness of various forecasters.

If you want to create your own exploratory notebook, using `exploratory_eval_template.Rmd` is a good idea. 

## Organization

* **RDS:** All .rds files (usually saved predictions).

* **R:** All .R files (usually exploratory forecasters).

All .Rmd and .html files are not organized in a folder at the moment. The filenames should start with the date it was created (in YYYY-MM-DD format), followed by some descriptive name. (Older files do not follow this convention at the moment.)
