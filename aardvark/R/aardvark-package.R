#' Carnegie Mellon Delphi Lab COVID-19 state death forecaster
#'
#' The production package for the \strong{Carnegie Mellon Delphi Lab} COVID-19 state death forecaster.
#' This forecaster, which is submitted to the CDC as \emph{CMU-TimeSeries} is a basic AR-type time 
#' series model fit using lagged values of case counts and deaths as features. No assumptions 
#' are made regarding reopening or governmental interventions. The model is jointly fit across 
#' all 50 US states, after some time-alignment is performed as a preprocessing step to facilitate 
#' comparison between states. Heavier weight is placed on more recent training data, to account 
#' for nonstationarity in the underlying process. A lasso penalty is added to induce variable 
#' selection and prevent overfitting. Quantiles are computed using a residual (Gaussian) 
#' bootstrap, separately for each location.
